# Awesome Impact Evaluators [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of resources for understanding and implementing Impact Evaluators.

Impact Evaluators are a framework for coordinating work and aligning incentives in complex systems. They provide mechanisms for retrospectively evaluating and rewarding contributions based on their actual impact, helping solve coordination problems in public goods funding, research evaluation, and decentralized systems.
